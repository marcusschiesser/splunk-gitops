# Splunk Gitops

Template to store the complete configuration (apps and system configuration) of a Splunk installation running on Kubernetes in Git.

Having the complete configuration in a single repository is an important prerequisite to enjoy the [benefits of GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/).

To ensure that this template is running with future versions of Splunk, it is solely extending Splunk Docker images according to the [docker-splunk](https://splunk.github.io/docker-splunk/) configuration. Furthermore for deploying the images it is using the [splunk-operator](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator) for Kubernetes as recommended by Splunk.

The repository is the result of [my discussions about how to use Gitops with Splunk](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com/archives/C01M8M2R3AM/p1651309478456499?thread_ts=1650596987.931899&cid=C01M8M2R3AM).


## Usage

Clone the repository, then you can configure your Splunk installation by editing these files:

1. The system configuration is stored in its own app as considered best practice for Splunk. This example is using my [splunk-root-config](https://github.com/marcusschiesser/splunk-root-config) app.
2. External apps can be retrieved at build time from Github Releases or Splunkbase - you can define the dependencies to download directly in the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile).
3. Local apps are stored in the [`apps`](apps) folder. Copy apps that you want to include in your installation here - without their configuration (will be added in the next step).
4. The configuration of local and external apps can be overwritten with app folders in the [`config/apps`](config/apps) directory. You can configure local apps and external apps there.
5. The `SPLUNK_APPS_URL` variables in the `Dockerfile` must reference your local and external apps. Configure it accordingly.

> **Note**: Doing so, we nicely separate the different concerns: apps and their configuration and the different origins of an app (local or external).

## Build

According to the configuration in the previous step, the build process is generating a docker image that will be deployed using the `splunk-operator` in Kubernetes.

### Local Build

If you're not using external apps from Splunkbase (as in the example Dockerfile), you can build the image locally with this simple command:

```
docker build -t splunk-gitops .
```

In case you want to include external apps from Splunkbase (comment out the appropriate sections in the Dockerfile), then you can do the build like this:

```
export SPLUNKBASE_USERNAME=<YOUR SPLUNK BASE USERNAME>
export SPLUNKBASE_PASSWORD=<YOUR SPLUNK BASE PASSWORD>

docker build --secret id=SPLUNKBASE_USERNAME --secret id=SPLUNKBASE_PASSWORD -t splunk-gitops .
```

### Github Actions

For your CI/CD workflow, you don't want to build the images locally. I am using a [Github Action workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) to build the image and upload it to [Github Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

In case that you're adding Splunkbase apps (like in the example), then you need to set the following [Github secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) with your Splunkbase credentials to retrieve the packages:

```
SPLUNKBASE_USERNAME
SPLUNKBASE_PASSWORD
```

## Test

To check whether the file structure has been generated correctly you can start a bash shell in the image without running Splunk by calling:

```
docker run --entrypoint /bin/bash -it splunk-gitops
```

If everything looks fine, you can start Splunk by calling:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e "SPLUNK_PASSWORD=<password>" \
             -e "SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license" \
             -it --name so1 splunk-gitops
```

## Deployment

Deployment requires you to install the `splunk-operator` in your Kubernetes cluster. 

Then you'll reference the Docker image generated by the build step in the [Kubernetes YAML file](./kubernetes-manifest/standalone.yaml). You can then deploy the image with the following command:

``` 
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes-manifest/standalone.yaml
```

The example deploys a Splunk standalone installation in its own namespace called `test`.

Note that the configuration folder of the cluster (`/opt/splunk/etc/`) can be mounted as an [ephemeral storage](https://splunk.github.io/splunk-operator/StorageClass.html#ephemeral-storage) as its complete state is stored the Git repository.

Welcome to Gitops! :smile:

## TODOs

- Add hook after ansible has finished the configuration to do after system configuration tasks, e.g. adding users
